# Tavelers Of Catan
## Introduction
This is a repository for my A level coursework game, Travelers of Catan. It is based on the popular board game "Settlers of Catan" where players take turns developing their settlements on a hexagonal grid using the resources randomly generated.

## Purpose
I did not like the random elements of Settlers of Catan so wanted to make the collection of resources easier for players. There are also confusing rules regarding trading so I instead simplified these down. Finally I wanted to feel immersed in the world of Catan and what better way than giving the player a moveable piece on the board that they use to built their empire. These conclusions were drawn from my interview with my primary user for the NEA.

# Code
I chose to use Unity for this project as I had experience in their 2D services already from past game development experience. The project uses Unity Version 2021.3.31f1 due to its long term support. All animations and game assets are from the unity store or copyright free sources. 

## Running
To run the game in Unity, fork the repo and download this version of Unity. When opening Unity select Open Project From Folder and select the folder within the repo root `Unity/TravelersOfCatan`.

# Todo
Add compiled game to github artefact
